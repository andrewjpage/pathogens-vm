{"name":"Pathogens-vm","tagline":"A virtual machine with Sanger pathogens software installed","body":"A virtual machine made by the Pathogen Informatics team of the Sanger Institute, which\r\nincludes the following software developed by the Pathogens group.\r\n* [Artemis](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/)\r\n  and [ACT](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/act/)\r\n* [Gubbins](http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/gubbins/)\r\n* [IVA](http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva/)\r\n* [PAGIT](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/pagit/), which includes\r\n  [ABACAS](http://abacas.sourceforge.net/),\r\n  [IMAGE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/image2/),\r\n  [iCORN](http://icorn.sourceforge.net/) and\r\n  [RATT](http://ratt.sourceforge.net/)\r\n* [REAPR](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/reapr/)\r\n\r\nThe virtual machine is based on\r\n[Bio-Linux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/),\r\nand so it also includes all the\r\n[software that comes with Bio-Linux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux-software-list/).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get and use the virtual machine\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your computer.\r\n2. Download the\r\n   [latest virtual machine](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/pathogens-vm/pathogens-vm.latest.ova)\r\n   or browse the\r\n   [directory of older versions](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/).\r\n3. Start VirtualBox and choose File -> Import Appliance from the menu\r\n4. Choose the downloaded OVA file from step 2 and click 'Continue'.\r\n5. Click on import and wait for VirtualBox to import the virtual machine.\r\n6. Start the virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe password for the default user 'manager' is 'manager'.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nFor any feedback, questions or help, please email path-help AT sanger DOT ac DOT uk.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor developers - how to build a new virtual machine\r\n===================================================\r\nInstructions can be found on the\r\n[pathogens-vm github repository](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/pathogens-vm).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
